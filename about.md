  Hey there! We are at Red-Gadget post blogs about any new technology that has a potential to become a big hit in the near future.
</p>

There were lot of challenges while bringing this blog out. Almost all of them are met today.

## How it all happened?

We started this blog on 8th of October 2014. The intention was to try a blog through which we can be up to date about the latest technology. We are happy that this blog has helped many people in chosing their gadgets right.

Some facts about the blog:

* Built on Jekyll
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with [Prose](http://prose.io), an amazing online editor
* Designed and developed in a small town.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/poole/issues/new) or [ask me on email](mailto:kopnicinc@gmail.com).

Thanks for reading!
