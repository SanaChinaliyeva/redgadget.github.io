##Hosting a blog on github

###Brief steps
1. Create a repository

2. Start a blog or fork a starting point

3. Using [prose.io](http://prose.io) for updating the blog


##Step 1 Create a Repository

There are many tutorial sites for this. This [official tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/) is enough to start off. So I'm not gonna waste any time on explaining that. 

##Step 2 Start a blog or fork a starting point

Starting a blog from scratch is not easy. You have to make your own template and styles. This may seem tedious job to do. So there is a better way to do that. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a [static website](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) generator that helps you create your blog and makes it easier to post.


You can find a starting point here in [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). You can also find different templates in [Jekyllthemes](http://jekyllthemes.org). Fork any of the repository to have a starting point.
