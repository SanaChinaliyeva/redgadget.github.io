It was 4 years ago, I was trying all the custom ROMs possible on my Samsung Galaxy i9003. This was one of the earliest galaxy mobiles by Samsung.

As every other developer, I was reading a thread on XDA-developers. I found that there is something called MIUI and it is look-alike of iOS. 

Wow!! This is the perfect blend! The style and beauty of iOS and features and customizability of android mixed together. I was fascinated by the ROM. I tried it. It was amazing (for the first few days). It was still in the alpha version. It screwed up my mobiles battery. MIUI is beautiful and heavily themed. I still love MIUI for the beauty!

##The Ringtone!
While using MIUI, I set my ringtone as 'Orange'. I never noticed it's melody because it sounded like just another chinese ringtone in chinese mobiles (no offense MIUI - made in china).

But people around me started to ask "what ringtome is that? Could you send it to me?"
Then I realized it really is melodious. Again a perfect blend! 

Today, though I don't use MIUI, I have kept the 'Orange' ringtone with me.
