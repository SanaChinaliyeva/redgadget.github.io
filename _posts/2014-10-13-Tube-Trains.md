London is getting new Tube trains for the next 40 years. Last week, London unveiled the new cars to the public for the first time.


<b>New Tube for London</b> (NTfL) is a programme that would introduce new trains and signalling on several London Underground deep-tube lines between 2025 and 2033. The fully automated trains would increase capacity on the Piccadilly, Central, Waterloo & City, Bakerloo lines. The trains may not have drivers, however the ASLEF and RMT trade unions that represent the drivers strongly oppose this, saying it would be unsafe
