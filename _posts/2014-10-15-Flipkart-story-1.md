## A different story than others
A lot of people have expressed their resentment towards flipkart. I have  a different story to share. Read on.



I have been looking to buy a decent phone for quite a long time now. I heard about Flipkart's big Billion day and was waiting for it. So I got up early in the morning and logged into flipkart .When I saw it ,I was shocked. I had never seen such an offer before and never was going to believe that I will ever see an offer like this in my life time.I was feeling blessed when I realized I was going to save so much and also have a new sexy mobile phone.Really dream come true moment for me.

Meanwhile I was also having so many plans on how to spend this 1 Re I was going to save. My friends were telling me to invest it in Mutual funds ( of course , only the remaining money left with me after I treat them). My Dad  wanted to buy me a new car with this money. I was feeling like Rajinikanth  in Sivaji the Boss for the whole time. But ..

Then my dreams came crashing down. There was some technical glitch and I could not buy the phone.


Now I am all heart broken, ruminating those wonderful moments where I was just inches away from realizing my dreams of owning a good phone bought at a price astonishingly lower than its actual price.While writing this,tears roll down my eyes. Such is life.I wish I get lucky on some other big billion day.


PS : one more funny offer someone found out. 

50k Rs.  pendrive. Now you will ALWAYS remove safely :D
