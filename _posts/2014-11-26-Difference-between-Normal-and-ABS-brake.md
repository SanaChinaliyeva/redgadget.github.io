Nature tries to teach us many things. There is always a better way than the ones way we are following.

Imagine how a plant can produce food out of sunlight **carbon-dioxide**, **water** and **minerals**! This must be the ultimate technology that we can possibly find. Not to forget it's by-product **Oxygen**.

How clean is that! 

Why can't we think of a solution to the problems in a 'natural' way. Let's build a tree. We are technically so advanced that we are building a tree, a big tree with leafs of length around 5 meters! Let's say it can suck **CO<em>2</em>** in a significant scale. It gives out **O<em>2</em>** as by-product. It produces a huge pile of **Mash potatoes** everyday!

Seems like a science fiction right. But there could be a day when every house will have this panel (leaf) on their house which produces **Oxygen**, **Energy** and **Food** for them! 

We just have to go along with the nature, not against it. Nature will embrace us rather killing us by Tsunami.
