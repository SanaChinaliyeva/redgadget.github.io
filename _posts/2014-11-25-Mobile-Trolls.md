#Microsoft Trolls Siri in a sarcastic way reminding that iPhone 6 is the same old iPhone 5 with a bigger screen.


Maybe what you need isn’t a bigger phone, but a more personal, personal assistant. Cortana, on the Lumia 830, does more than Siri. Like alert you to leave early for an appointment using traffic alerts. Cortana can even remind you of things based on who calls or texts.

Samsung did the same thing this year even before the release of iPhone 6.
