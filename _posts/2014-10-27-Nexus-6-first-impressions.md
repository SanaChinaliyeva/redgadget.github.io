##Mega Moto X
Google's new phone doesn't look anything like its predecessors, but it has a rather uncanny resemblance to the Moto X. In fact, it looks almost exactly like a blown-up version of Motorola's flagship, with only a few exceptions.

##Qhad HD AMOLED
The screen isn't just big -- it's as high-definition as you can get these days, thanks to the Quad HD AMOLED panel. That's 2,560 x 1,440 pixels spread over the 5.96-inch display, which comes out to a pixel density of 493 ppi. When turned on and set to the lowest possible brightness, the display changes to a pinkish glow. This actually comes in incredibly handy when trying to read something in a pitch dark room.
 

###What's AMOLED?
Active Matrix Organic Light Emitting Diode, technology has grown in popularity in recent years. AMOLED screens consist of a thin layer of organic polymers that light up when zapped with an electric current. Due to this simple construction, AMOLED screens can be extremely thin and do not require a backlight. The benefit of losing a backlight is readily apparent: these screens are able to produce blacks so deep that the screen pixels can shut right off. Shutting off pixels can also save electricity and battery life in phones and tablets. Just keep your backgrounds close to black and youâ€™ll save energy!

Cons: Poor viewability in direct sunlight.
