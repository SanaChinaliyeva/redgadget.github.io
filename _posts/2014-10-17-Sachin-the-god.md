There are two versions of the future(technology): one which goes in the way of the Terminator, with robots based on pure logic and another full of emotions, -like Wall-E, a cute robot full of emotions who saves humans from logical robots. **EmoSpark** belongs to the latter.

**EmoSpark** the world’s first home artificial intelligence console is an **android** powered Wi-Fi/Bluetooth cube which will recognize each family member’s preferences, that uses emotion text and content analysis to measure the emotional responses of its users. In fact, it actually detects the moods of several people in the room at a time, the same way people do, through facial recognition and learning to interact through conversation.


Technically, **EmoSpark** accesses NASA’s MODIS satellite, the Freebase and Wiki databases and results in a platform so innovative it will spin the entertainment world on its side.
Every **EmoSpark** has access to a communication grid, accessed only by other cubes, so will be able to recognize other cubes with a similar emotional profile. It can share media enjoyed by other cubes and then recommend this for your enjoyment(cubes can share only media files, so privacy will not be lost). It can interact with the family, help with homework and provide up-to-the-minute updates about anything local or global.

Since it is an A.I. device, it continues to learn and fine-tune its results over time.
- As like our brain **EmoSpark** can also perceive and process billions of signals and stimuli over time. 

- The Cube connected to Google, Wikipedia and other free resources and is able to answer and project answers in over 39 million topics. 

- You can interact **EmoSpark** by using your Smart phone, Tablet, T. v or PC. 

* **EmoSpark** can interact with individuals on a custom, conversational basis because it will recognize the user’s face.

* As interactions become more frequent, **EmoSpark** will capture and store each emotional nuance with the sole intention of making the user happy.
**EmoSpark** learns everything from you, the way you interact with it, comments and responses.

* **EmoSpark** can feel an infinite variety in the emotional spectrum based on 8 primary human emotions, Joy, Sadness, Trust, Disgust, Fear, Anger, Surprise and Anticipation. 

* This Cube Measure your behavior and emotions, then in turn it will create a emotion profile that make you happy and feel comfortable.

* While it builds each unique Emotional Profile Graph (EPG), it will virtually “feel” sensations and emotions.

* The applications are unlimited. It already works with users’ smart phones, computers, televisions and games and can connect to Facebook, YouTube, Air play and more.

* The **EmoSpark** cube also doubles as an e-learning tool.

The cube's capabilities lets it install compatible new apps from the Google Play App store, increasing its ability for new functional blocks such as chat bots, new voices, or interfacing with Robot like NAO, Sphero or any other AI technology. I hope it will be released in near future. It costs around Rs.15,000-25,000(USD$260-$315).
