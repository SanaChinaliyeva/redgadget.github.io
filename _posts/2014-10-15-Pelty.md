##Lightthe fire, play the music
Pelty represents a technological revolution in the high-quality audio speakersâ€™ market. Pelty is innovative and unique in the world because it is powered exclusively by a wax candle. Thanks to a patented technology based on the Peltier effect, it transforms the thermal energy of the fire of a candle into electric energy able to turn on the speaker and amplify the music. The wireless bluetooh technology and the total absence of wires make of Pelty an object of complicated technological design.
