#Yandex is the simplest yet beautiful form of a browser.

Till date we have seen browsers with ugly navigation bars, bookmark tabs, settings menu, unused extensions etc., Now you can get rid of all those and have a pure website experience through **Yandex Browser**.

First impression will remind you of the apps in Windows 8. The top navigation bar is simple with just the website description and four buttons on the top-right corner. One more thing to note is that the navigation bar is **translucent**! It changes it's colors with the webpage you are browsing.

This is how the nav-bar looks like when you are browsing facebook.

Yandex is a tidy new browser from Russian developers based on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.chromium.org/Home"><strong>Chromium Open Source project</strong></a>. It uses the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.opera.com/turbo" ><strong>Turbo technology</strong></a> of the browser Opera for slow connections. It's still in **beta version** but very promising.

As you see on the above image, this is how a google page is shown on the browser. The tabs show up on the bottom of the screen. Initially I thought this could be a problem while reading something on the browser but the whole tab-bar stays below the web-page! Clever isn't it?!

I like the way it suggests web pages just by typing the name. Unlike other browsers where you have to type the whole URL or google the name, this feature saves a lot of time.

I have used **Yandex launcher** before, on my android smartphone and I must admit that it's the most beautiful and user friendly launcher I have ever used. Yandex is doing great in the  design aspect. Will it do the same in performance? We should wait for the first version of the browser.

Since it uses Chromium source, it runs in multiple processes just the chrome does it. Every extension is a new process. This may lead to higher CPU usage on low end PCs.

But this shouldn't be a problem on the high end PCs.

#The perks

1. The new simple design is the most notable feature of the browser. 

2. Combining the most wanted features of **Chrome** and **Opera**

3. Webpage security with the Yandex security system and checks downloaded files with Kaspersky anti-virus


#Cons

1. The browser being Russian, a place known for internet hackers, users may think twice while using the browser.

2. There is no direct access to Bookmarks. However you can click on the settings menu to get that.


**Final Verdict:**

We would recommend you to go for this browser, this could be the one you have always been looking for - A pure browsing experience!
