This $150 device is a discreet wireless earbud designed to look good and feel great. It gives you complete control of your phone and allows you to access everything you need by just using your voice.

Pair it with your Moto X and ask questions like, “What’s today’s forecast?” or “How do I get home?” and get answers directly in your ear. You can also hear notifications, make calls, and send messages without having to touch or look at your phone.
When you aren’t using Moto Hint, keep it in your ear and still hear everything around you clearly with pass-through audio
