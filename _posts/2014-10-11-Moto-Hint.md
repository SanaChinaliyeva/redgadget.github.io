This $150 device is a discreet wireless earbud designed to look good and feel great. It gives you complete control of your phone and allows you to access everything you need by just using your voice.

Pair it with your Moto X and ask questions like, “What’s today’s forecast?” or “How do I get home?” and get answers directly in your ear. You can also hear notifications, make calls, and send messages without having to touch or look at your phone.
When you aren’t using Moto Hint, keep it in your ear and still hear everything around you clearly with pass-through audio

Moto Hint is compatible with any Bluetooth® enabled smartphone so you can get hands-free calling with up to 150 feet of roam range. You can keep Moto Hint charged on the go in its accompanying charge case, and get up to 10 hours of talk time. The case carries two extra charges, so you can use Moto Hint all day. The best part is Moto Hint has lightweight design that ensures a comfortable fit in your ear, and you can choose from a variety of colors and materials.

It automatically detects if you have kept the device in the ears. Motorola doesn't want to call it a bluetooth headset because it is a lot more than a bluetooth headset.
