**Google** when spelled backwards becomes **elgooG**, But the interesting fact is we can also use http://www.elgoog.im for our searches.

- **elgooG** is the mirror image of Google search engine; not only is all of its content a reversal of Google, the search terms must also be written in reverse order to yield the desired results.

* Though created for fun purpose, it found practical use in the People's Republic of China after the domestic banning of Google, as it circumvented the government firewalls.

It is definitely worth a try.
