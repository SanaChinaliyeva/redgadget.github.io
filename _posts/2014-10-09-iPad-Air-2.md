Vietnamese blog [Tinhte.vn](https://www.tinhte.vn/threads/hinh-anh-day-co-phai-la-mo-hinh-cua-ipad-air-moi.2371061/#9to5mac) (via [9to5Mac](http://9to5mac.com/2014/10/08/ipad-air-2-leaks/)) is showing off pictures of what it claims is the next generation of the Apple tablet.

The leaks show the next generation iPad to be mostly identical to the current iPad Air, but with some notable changes. Aside from thinness, the iPad now features a ‘glass’ (likely sapphire) Touch ID home button to match previous rumors. Interestingly, the side shots of the device appear to lack a mute switch.

It isn’t clear what stage of development this ‘iPad Air 2′ is from. From the pictures, it doesn’t seem like a mere dummy unit, but the poor finish on the back side appears to suggest this is somewhat of a prototype and not ‘final’ hardware. However, the video almost certainly depicts a dummy unit, which may offer an alternative explanation for the lack of mute switch (simply incomplete dummy)
