HTC has been doing a lot of innovative things in the smartphone section. This is a welcome change that HTC put their hands on to cameras.

##Live life in full view
With a stunning yet minimalist cylindrical design, RE is made to be held, and fits naturally and comfortably in the palm of your hand. Never worry about missing a moment fumbling between modes, as RE’s built-in grip sensor instantly activates the camera as it’s picked up, eliminating the need for a power button. Its large, tactile shutter button captures photos with a single tap and videos with a longer press, making it fun and super-easy to capture high-quality, creative imagery or video.
