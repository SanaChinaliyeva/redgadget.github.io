HTC has been doing a lot of innovative things in the smartphone section. This is a welcome change that HTC put their hands on to cameras. Though it looks like an asthma inhaler, it's awesome in what it does!

##Live life in full view
With a stunning yet minimalist cylindrical design, RE is made to be held, and fits naturally and comfortably in the palm of your hand. Never worry about missing a moment fumbling between modes, as RE’s built-in grip sensor instantly activates the camera as it’s picked up, eliminating the need for a power button. Its large, tactile shutter button captures photos with a single tap and videos with a longer press, making it fun and super-easy to capture high-quality, creative imagery or video.\

The $199.99 Re Camera has a pared-down, minimalist design, a button on the front and a button on the back, and a couple of LED indicator lights. There's no viewfinder, no display, and no graphical user interface. Its 16-megapixel sensor is set behind an ultra-wide angle (146-degree) fixed-focus lens and can shoot 1080p HD video at 30 frames per second or slow motion 720p video at 120 frames per second. It will be available in orange, blue, teal, and white in the US later this month.

##Share with a click
When photos and videos look this great, they shouldn’t be kept to yourself. RE interacts with your smartphone through the RE application, which syncs photos, videos and time-lapse recordings seamlessly over WiFi – meaning that you can relive and share your experiences at the touch of a button. Available on Android and iOS, there is no need to edit or sync to your PC, as the RE app backs up those precious memories to your phone or the cloud, working in harmony with the Zoe app to instantly create shareable video highlight reels that look professionally edited.
