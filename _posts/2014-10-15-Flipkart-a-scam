title: "Flipkart Big Billion Day Story!"

In my opinion, Flipkart’s “The big billion day” was a huge scam.
First let me explain what I did. Instead of manually refreshing the page every 5 seconds to check if new "STEAL DEALS" had arrived, I wrote a simple python script to do the same. You can check out my python script here. (shadowfax92/flipkart_parser.py)

Basically, the script parsed Flipkart’s page every 5 seconds to see if any new product had arrived in “STEAL DEAL” section. If a new product had arrived, my scripted shouted “Ring Ring Ring” (Thanks to OS X “say” command :P) on my mac and then send out a mail along with few product details like Name of product, discount offered/price, status of product (whether sold out or not) and the link to the "shop now"/"view product" page. What I noticed (once the script started working) is very bizarre. Whenever a new product arrived (the one's with crazy discounts like 90% and above) in the “STEAL DEAL” section, it was already in “Sold out” state. This basically means two things, either someone bought all of these products within 5 seconds (which is very unlikely) or Flipkart was simply fooling the customers into believing that they were too late in selecting the product. I think the latter case is more plausible. 
Indirectly, Flipkart was attracting a huge number of customers to their page who finally ended up buying the next best thing.

Few of the sample mails sent by my script:
