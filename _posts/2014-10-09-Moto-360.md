title: Moto 360 review

---

No other gear has made so much noise as Moto 360. There is a reason for that. Moto's motto of making products that doesn't suck. Moto x, Moto G are smartphones without any high-end specs  but they sold out like pancakes because of the same reason, they delivered a pretty sweet experience that a lot of people liked. Let's see why Moto 360 stands out of any other Android wearable devices.

##classic design
Moto 360 stays true to the timeless form of the classic wristwatch. A round design maximizes the display area while ensuring a comfortable fit, so you can get the information you want conveniently on your wrist.

##Timely updates at a glance
Moto 360 displays timely notifications based on where you are and what you’re doing, so you always stay on track. Weather, flight alerts, traffic, and more, all powered by Android Wear.

##Responds to your voice
Voice control makes it easy to get things done, even when your hands are full. Just say “Ok Google” and you can send texts, set a reminder, check the weather and even ask for directions.

Keep track of your steps and know your heart rate thanks to a built-in pedometer and heart rate monitor. Plus, only the Moto 360 heart activity app tracks your progress toward your goals using daily and weekly benchmarks.

Moto 360 makes the first head-turning among all the Android wear in the market. This is not only beautiful but also has a great functionality and purpose. Motorola again shines in winning hearts of many tech junkies.

I have been following MKBHD and his reviews from a long time and I think his review sums it all up.
