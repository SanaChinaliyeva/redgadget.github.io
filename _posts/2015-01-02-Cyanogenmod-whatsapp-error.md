Installing Cyanogenmod is easy these days using one click installer. Many users started using CM as a daily driver. There can be problems after installing CM. Some of them are

1. Whatsapp unable to send or receive pictures and vodeos

2. Unable to take screenshots.

3. Unable to capture pictures.

>Error Message: Not enough storage


File manager can detect file-system but some apps don't. These problems are related to storage permission. 

#Solution:

##Whatsapp Error: 

* Goto File manager. Navigate to folder 'Whatsapp'. 
* Copy all the contents in the folder and paste it in a new folder say 'newfold'.
* Now delete the 'Whatsapp' folder.
* Create a new folder and name it 'Whatsapp'.
* Move all the contents you backed up earlier in 'newfold' to 'Whatsapp'.
* Now try sending pictures and videos in Whatsapp.

##Unable to take screenshots & pictures

The solution is quite similat to the solution for whatsapp error.


* Goto File manager. Navigate to folder 'Pictures'. 
* Copy all the contents in the folder and paste it in a new folder say 'newfold'.
* Now delete the 'Pictures' folder.
* Create a new folder and name it 'Pictures'.
* Move all the contents you backed up earlier in 'newfold' to 'Pictures'.
* Now try capturing pictures and taking screenshots.
