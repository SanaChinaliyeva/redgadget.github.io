Sony has built a watch made entirely of e-paper where the band and the watch face would both change in response to the user's wrist gestures!

The watch is extremely thin and makes no pretense of being smart, relying on the chameleonic flexibility of its appearance and a clean minimalist shape to win over fans. Because it has no sophisticated electronics inside, it's also said to last as long as 60 days on a single button battery

Make no mistake, the watch is not even remotely poised to being smart in any way and instead relies on its chameleon-like abilities and clean shape to draw praise from consumers. Where the e-paper provides the watch to instantaneously shuffle through watch faces and band patterns.

The company is also looking into making bow ties (see video below), hat and shoe accessories, and paper holders out of electronic paper. There's no release date set for this watch yet, however supporters on the Japanese crowdfunding site Makuake have been told they'll be able to get theirs some time after May of next year.
