Understanding End Game is really important.
In pawn endgames where there are very few msterial, your objective is normally not to checkmate the opponent but promoting the pawn.


Square of the pawn

saves a lot of time calculating when under time pressure.

Connected passed pawns: talk about two pawns against king

There is a chance of stalemate. Avoid that by playing
Kf5 Kg7

Sacrifice the pawn

h8=Q Kxh8

Kf6 Kg8

g7 Kh7
Kf7 and win

-------------------------------------

Attacking: Attacking is the preference of most of the players like Bobby fishcher

When you wanna attack you need to know 2 things
attack at 

right time

right place

if you have more attackers then that's the time to strike. If not you should wait.

It is useful when you have a target to attack.
