Understanding End Game is really important.
In pawn endgames where there are very few msterial, your objective is normally not to checkmate the opponent but promoting the pawn.

saves a lot of time calculating when under time pressure.

There is a chance of stalemate. Avoid that by playing
Kf5 Kg7

Sacrifice the pawn

h8=Q Kxh8

Kf6 Kg8

g7 Kh7
Kf7 and win

Attacking: Attacking is the preference of most of the players like Bobby fishcher

When you wanna attack you need to know 2 things
attack at 

right time

right place

if you have more attackers then that's the time to strike. If not you should wait.

It is useful when you have a target to attack.
